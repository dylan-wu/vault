Our sun is the most massive object in our solar system, taking up 99.8% of the total mass of the solar system.

The sun is a normal main-sequence G2 star, now, when we say normal, we don't mean that the sun is "average". The sun is normal in the sense that there are many others similar to it, but our sun is actually in the top 10% of stars by mass, and the median size of stars in our galaxy is likely less than half the mass of the sun.
