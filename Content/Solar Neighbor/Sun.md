fOur sun is the most massive object in our solar system, taking up 99.8% of the total mass of the solar system.

The sun is a normal main-sequence G2 star, now, when we say normal, we don't mean that the sun is "average". The sun is normal in the sense that there are many others similar to it, but our sun is actually in the top 10% of stars by mass, and the median size of stars in our galaxy is likely less than half the mass of the sun.

The sun is powered by nuclear fusion, using the incredible pressures and temperatures within itself to fuse hydrogen into helium, and in the future to fuse helium into other, heavier elements.

The sun is not a solid body, but rather a collection of plasma, as such, the outer layers of the sun can exhibit different rotations, for example, the equator of the surface roates once every 25.4 days, while at the poles it's as much as 36 days.
