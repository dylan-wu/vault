    "# Sentiment Classification the old-fashioned way:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Naive Bayes`, `Logistic Regression`, and `Ngrams`\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to show how sentiment classification is done via the classic techniques of `Naive Bayes`, `Logistic Regression`, and `Ngrams`. We will be using `sklearn` and the `fastai` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a future lesson, we will revisit sentiment classification using `deep learning`, so that you can compare the two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content here was extended from Lesson 10 of the fast.ai Machine Learning course. Linear model is pretty close to the state of the art here. Jeremy surpassed state of the art using RNN in fall 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. The fastai library\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin using the fastai library (version 1.0) in this notebook. We will use it more once we move on to neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastai library is built on top of PyTorch and encodes many state-of-the-art best practices. It is used in production at a number of companies. You can read more about it here:\n",
    "- Fast.ai's software could radically democratize AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The IMDB dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The large movie review dataset contains a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB, We will use the version hosted as part fast.ai datasets on AWS Open Datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains an even number of positive and negative reviews. The authors considered only highly polarized reviews. A negative review has a score ≤ 4 out of 10, and a positive review has a score ≥ 7 out of 10. Neutral reviews are not included in the dataset. The dataset is divided into training and test sets. The training set is the same 25,000 labeled reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment classification task consists of predicting the polarity (positive or negative) of a given text.\n",
