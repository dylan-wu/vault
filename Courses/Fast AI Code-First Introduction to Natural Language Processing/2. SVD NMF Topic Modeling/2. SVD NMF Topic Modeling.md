What is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)?

What is Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)?
- SVD is a matrix factorization 

What is Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

Stemming and Lemmatization

Are the words below the same?
- organize, organizes, and organizing
- democracy, democratic, and democratization

What does stemming and lemmatization do?
- Generates the root form of words
- Lemmatization uses rules about a language, and resulting tokens take the form of actual words
